Do the power point



Deploy to git hub tomorrow

Done:
Get the main page to look regular
Deleete the full list and clean up references. 
Main page to have the full table as well toggle. 
    Then for level D, hide all the stuff and just show the full table.
    Update the item details to deal with type and make the middle look better
    comment out the mobile stuff for now.  Let me get the program and vision going. Then I will go back to mobile.
