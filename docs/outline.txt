What to do I need to do to get first interation done functional wise?
This doesn't count layout or pretty wise

1)Main page
    Other than look and layout, this page is done
2) Open full table
    A) need to fill in all data for each issues. The detaisl would be awesome
3) Create issues   
    A)Logic for issue type
        1)Direct report
            Leader to notify goes away
            employee involed are only her employees

        2) Self, then show 
            leader to notify stays
            and employee involed goes away

        3) Another emploee 
            leader to notify goes away
            and employee involed are not her employees (can be anyone)
            The owner of the issue is the leader for the emploee

                Where does this display?
                Talbe able issues she created but doesn't own?  display in her table, but different owner and she is creator?

        4) Leader   
            employees turns to leader involed and is a select list
            leader to notify stays there
        About another employee

4) Open issue needs to read a couple issues from files and display them
